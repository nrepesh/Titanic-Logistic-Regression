# Titanic-Logistic-Regression

Predict a classification- survival or deceased

I used Pandas for data analysis and Matplotlib/seaborn for data visualization.

Cleaned data and fitted a logistic regression model and used it to classify survival. Finally, I evaluated the results using an evaluation matrix.
